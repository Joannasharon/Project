   <h4>Why you need a personal website?</h4>
</div>

<div class="content">
  <p> A personal website help people to have a visual representation of who you are.
Since a personal website also includes your work experience and education, 
in this respect it's similar to a resume. Some even consider it a personal resume website.
What sets a website apart from a resume is the fact that you only need to update it. 
You'll keep adding fresh things to your personal website - new projects, awards, skills, etc.
