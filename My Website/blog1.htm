   <h4>Designer vs Developer</h4>
</div>

<div class="content">
  <p> A web designer is someone who designs and styles the overall layout and look for website.
A web developer is the one who develops applications and functionality for the internet.
Web developer focuses on front-end programming languages like HTML,CSS and JavaScript 
while another developer focus on server side programming languages like PHP,Java,Ruby,and.NET.
Web designers must always begin by considering a client's objectives and then move on with their design. 
Web developers take the design created and build a fully functioning website.

   <h4>Can you be a web designer and developer?</h4>
</div>

<div class="content">
 <p> Web designers have a creative mindset whereas web developers usually think methodically and logically.
As they have different mindsets it is hard to find a good web designer who is also a good web developer.
No one can be expert at everything.That is when the project manager effectively manage projects and make sure
the developers and designers are on the same page.Eventhough you can be both, you will always be better at one,but 
your goal should be to have some aptitude in each.
